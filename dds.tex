\title{The DDS WG at MIC}

\section{Topic}
(Representation of) reference in distributional semantics

Not a topic: how to use DS (as a component in other systems)
to deal with reference


\section{Subtopics and questions}



\paragraph{Commonsense-based coreference.}
coreference that can be solved based on general commonsense
knowledge, of the sort that distributional semantics should
be good at capturing.
(Winograd schemas)

\paragraph{DS models of slots.} Ji and Eisenstein paper.

\paragraph{Maybe we do not need to do anything,
  vectors/embeddings suffice?} Aurelie Herbelot paper.

\paragraph{DS was never meant to be a theory of
  everything. Is reference one of the phenomena that we
  should not use DS to explain?}

\paragraph{Reference in the sense of the Pado/Baroni EMNLP
  paper.} But this is actually not about the reference that
we define as the topic?


\section{Examples}

\paragraph{Plain
pronoun, where
disambiguation really depends on context and not on generic
conceptual
properties}

``The teacher entered the classroom.
He looked scary.''

How do we represent, in distributed terms, ``He looked
scary'' in a way that
captures the fact that it should entail: ``The teacher
looked scary''.

\paragraph{Definite vs indefinite.}

How do we represent, distributionally/distributedly, the
difference between:

The teacher entered the classroom.

and:

A teacher entered the classroom.

How does this representation changes if they are the first
sentences in a
text, or if they are uttered in a context in which we know
that we are
speaking of the classroom where Mr. Smith teaches?

\paragraph{Proper nouns.}

And finally, coming to proper names, how do we capture the
relation between:

A teacher entered the classroom.

and:

John entered the classroom.

(Assuming Mr. Smith's first name is John).

Perhaps, this last issue is just a matter of having enough
training data
for the specific John at hand, but still ``John'' seems to
come with a set of
presupposition that are different from those of ``a
teacher'', and more like
those of ``the teacher'': how do we handle this?

\paragraph{Referentially identical: same or different
  vectors?}
The next and last example is actually from Gemma's MC
project, so if we
decide to use it we should credit it to her:

The Beatles broke up in 1970.

The best-selling band of the sixties broke up in 1970.

Again, how do we capture the relation between these two
sentences?
